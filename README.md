# Star Pizza

## Game Description
In a far way galaxy the little clown-Ship  has to defend the galaxy against the  evil A.G.A.I.N.S.T Pizza empire while  still needs to deliver a hot pizza.

## Project 

This was a project that a did in Unity using basic knowledge, studying some aspects of the engine as:

- Terrain Tool
- Timeline, Animation Track and Control Track
- Study more about Particle System and Colliders to it
- Play for the fist Time with **Asset Store**
- Used Canvas and TextMeshPro and Images
- Add Music to the game with *Singleton Pattern* 

## The Course 

I made this Game following the [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/) course from [GameDevTv] (https://github.com/CompleteUnityDeveloper2) but I didnâ€™t do exactly as in the course for example me Game doesn't have the 3 minutes experience because my main focus its learn how to use the engine and how to code for it.

But the experience was a lot funnier a had a lot of issues that a had to rack my brain on it, but I want to advance and learn new things soon.

## Gameplay

Heres its a little bit of the game play:
